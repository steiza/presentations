# Infrastructure Automation at Duo
### Presented by Zach Steindler

Duo uses Ansible for much of their infrastructure automation. As in, near all of it. Zach Steindler will present how they've used Ansible to ensure that anyone in their 100+ person engineering team can easily do the following:
- Look up how production is configured... even if they don't have production access.
- Make (some) production changes... even without production access
- Put together infrastructure for a new service that is secure and maintainable
- Test out infrastructure changes in a completely separate account

Big thanks to  LLamasoft for both hosting and providing food for the first Orchestructure of 2019!
